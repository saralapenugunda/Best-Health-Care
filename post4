<h2>What is mental health?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the terms are often used interchangeably, poor mental health and mental illness are not the same. A person can experience poor mental health and not be diagnosed with a mental illness. Likewise, a person diagnosed with a mental illness can experience periods of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/wellbeing.htm">physical, mental, and social well-being</a>.</p>

<h2>Why is mental health important for overall health?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.&nbsp; For example, depression increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/managing/mental-health.html">diabetes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/mentalhealth.htm">heart disease</a>, and stroke. Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness.<sup>2</sup></p>

<h2>Can your mental health change over time?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, it’s important to remember that a person’s mental health can change over time, depending on many factors.&nbsp; When the demands placed on a person exceed their resources and coping abilities, their mental health could be impacted. For example, if someone is working long hours, caring for a relative, or experiencing economic hardship, they may experience poor mental health.</p>
