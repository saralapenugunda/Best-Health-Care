<p>Healthy food refers to food that contains the right amount of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.toppr.com/guides/science/nutrition-in-animals/introduction-to-nutrition/">nutrients</a>&nbsp;to keep our body fit. We need healthy food to keep ourselves fit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, healthy food is also very delicious as opposed to popular thinking. Nowadays, kids need to eat healthy food more than ever.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most importantly, the harmful effects of junk food and the positive impact of healthy food must be stressed upon. People should teach kids from an early age about the same.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Healthy Food</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Healthy food does not have merely one but numerous benefits. It helps us in various spheres of life. Healthy food does not only impact our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.toppr.com/guides/economics/infrastructure/energy-health-and-functions-of-environment/">physical health but mental health</a>&nbsp;too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When we intake healthy fruits and vegetables that are full of nutrients, we reduce the chances of diseases. For instance, green vegetables help us to maintain strength and vigor. In addition, certain healthy food items keep away long-term illnesses like diabetes and blood pressure.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly, obesity is the biggest problems our country is facing now. People are falling prey to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.toppr.com/bytes/inculcating-exercise-young-age/">obesity</a>&nbsp;faster than expected. However, this can still be controlled. Obese people usually indulge in a lot of junk food. The junk food contains sugar, salt fats and more which contribute to obesity.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.toppr.com/guides/essays/health-is-wealth-essay/">Healthy</a>&nbsp;food can help you get rid of all this as it does not contain harmful things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>In addition, healthy food also helps you save money. It is much cheaper in comparison to junk food. Plus all that goes into the preparation of healthy food is also of low cost. Thus, you will be saving a great amount when you only consume healthy food.</p>

<h3>Junk food vs Healthy Food</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we look at the scenario today, we see how the fast-food market is increasing at a rapid rate. With the onset of food delivery apps and more, people now like having junk food more. In addition, junk food is also tastier and easier to prepare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, just to satisfy our taste buds we are risking our health. You may feel more satisfied after having junk food but that is just the feeling of fullness and nothing else. Consumption of junk food leads to poor concentration. Moreover, you may also get&nbsp;<a href="https://www.toppr.com/bytes/pay-attention-health/">digestive problems</a>&nbsp;as junk food does not have fiber which helps indigestion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly, irregularity of blood sugar levels happens because of junk food. It is so because it contains fewer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.toppr.com/guides/chemistry/biomolecule/">carbohydrates and protein</a>. Also, junk food increases levels of cholesterol and triglyceride.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, healthy food contains a plethora of nutrients. It not only keeps your body healthy but also your mind and soul. It increases our brain’s functionality. Plus, it enhances our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.toppr.com/bytes/absenteeism/">immunity system</a>. Intake of whole foods with minimum or no processing is the finest for one’s health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In short, we must recognize that though junk food may seem more tempting and appealing, it comes with a great cost. A cost which is very hard to pay. Therefore, we all must have healthy foods and strive for a longer and healthier life.</p>
